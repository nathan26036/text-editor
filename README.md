# Text Editor

The goal of this project is to build a text editor in the style of JavaScript. The text editor will also be able to be downloaded and used offline as an application.

## The process

### What i did
* Created scripts that will start be used to start the application, start just the server, start just the build and start the client
* Created a post to the database to store the text
* created a get to get the text from the db
* created a event listener on the button to show the install prompt and install the application once accepted
* Created a register route for the service worker to cache assets
* Added plugins for manifest for the offline application
